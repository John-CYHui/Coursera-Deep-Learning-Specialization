# Deep Learning Specialization Coursera [UPDATED Version 2021]
This repo contains all of the solved assignments of Coursera's most famous [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) of 5 courses offered by [deeplearning.ai](www.deeplearning.ai)

Instructor: [Prof. Andrew Ng](www.andrewng.org)

## What's New
This Specialization was updated in April 2021 to include developments in deep learning and programming frameworks. One of the most major changes was shifting from Tensorflow 1 to Tensorflow 2. Also, new materials were added.
However, Most of the old online repositories still don't have old codes.
This repo contains updated versions of the assignments.
Happy Learning :)
